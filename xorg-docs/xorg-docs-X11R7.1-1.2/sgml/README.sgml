X11R&relvers; is an Open Source versions of the X Window
System that supports many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such
as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other
platforms.  This version is compatible with X11R&prevrelvers; and other
X window system implementations which support the X11 standard.

<sect>What is X11R&relvers;?
<p>
<![ %updaterel [
X11R&relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to X11R&majorvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
X11R&relvers; series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.

<![ %majorrel [
X11R&relvers; is the first release in the new X11R&majorvers; series.
]]>

<![ %minorrel [
X11R&relvers; is the second release in the X11R&majorvers; series.
Tarballs for packages that have had updates since the &prevrelvers;
release are included in this release.  To build this release, you will
first need to get the packages from X11R&prevrelvers; and then add the
new packages from X11R&relvers; to them.

<![ %snapshot [
X11R&relvers; is a pre-release snapshot of X11R&fullrelvers;.
<![ %relcandidate [
This snapshot is release candidate &rcnum; for version &fullrelvers;.

Pre-release snapshots are provided for beta testing.  You should only install
snapshots if you're comfortable dealing with possibly unstable beta-level
software.  If you find problems with this snapshot, you are encouraged
to report your findings to the public X.Org server mailing list:
<email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in this release, and most PC
video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with the
"vesa" driver.  The <htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES3.html">

The X.Org Foundation X releases are produced by the X.Org Foundation.
The X.Org Foundation has been formed as a Delaware corporation organized
to operate as a scientific charity under IRS code 501(c)(3) chartered
to develop and execute effective strategies which provide world-wide
stewardship of the X Window System technology and standards. Membership
in the X.Org Foundation is free to all participants. Applications for
Membership are now being accepted, and active participants in the
further development of the X Window Technology are invited to complete a

codebase forms the sixth full X Window System release since the formation of
the X.Org Foundation and includes code from the X Consortium, the Open
Group and the XFree86&trade; project.  This release is dedicated to the
greater X community, developers and users alike.

<item>Copyright and/or license notices are reproduced verbatim in

This is the second release of the new modular source code tree.  The
source code has been split into nine logical modules: app, data, doc,
driver, font, lib. proto, util and xserver.  Each of these modules
contain one or more packages that can be configured, built and installed
separately.  Please see an X11R&relvers; release site for a complete
list of the tarballs.

For information on how to build the modular tree packages see the <url
name="Modular Developer's Guide"
url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide">.  This guide also
contains information for developers who want to help improve the modular
build system and modular code base.

<sect1>The current development tree
<p>
The X source code for this and all releases/snapshots as well as
development versions can also be accessed via the Freedesktop.org CVS
repository.  It's also possible to browse the <url name="freedesktop CVS
repository" url="http://cvs.freedesktop.org/xorg/">.  The CVS tag for
the &relvers; version is "&reltag;".

To check out the latest development version, don't specify any tag.


<sect>Reporting Bugs
<p>
Bugs should be reported to <url name="bug tracking system"
url="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/"> using the xorg component.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the server log file, which can be found at
<tt>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</tt> on most platforms.  If you can't resolve
the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug report but
not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit the log file as our
developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.  Please attach it
to your bug report.
